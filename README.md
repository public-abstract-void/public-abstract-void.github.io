## ASSIGNMENT 1:

Dark Souls is a 2011 action role-playing game (ARPG) developed by From Software. On top of exploring and adventuring through a dark fantasy world, users may also engage in player-versus-player (PvP) combat by invading other users' worlds. In order to have the best chances of winning, some people would even go so far as to build their characters in such a way as to maximize every resource at their disposal, an idea known as "minmaxxing"; of the minmaxxed builds in Dark Souls, the most infamous was GIANTDAD, the figure pictured in ASSIGNMENT 1, doing the taunt appropriately named, "Well, What is it?"

## ASSIGNMENT 2:

A simple solar system simulation to show off textures, basic animations, and an example of a preprocessing effect (grayscale).

## ASSIGNMENT 3:

THE GAME OF LIFE! 2048 x 2048, workgroups and compute shader logic.

## ASSIGNMENT 4:

A simple particle system that showcases fire and a bunch of bouncing balls! The balls are also textured, have different colors, wrap, respawn, and a bunch of other stuff! Beware though - there are a lot of them (12K+)!
